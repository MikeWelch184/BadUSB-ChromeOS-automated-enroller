# BadUSB-ChromeOS-automated-enroller
The Duckyscript file in this repository is responsible for automatically enrolling Google Chromebooks into a Google Workspace.

  I work in a K-12 Google Workspace shop. This is a Tool I wrote based on Amplified ITs project centipede. https://www.amplifiedit.com/centipede/ . 
Essentially you use a script and a USB that injects keystrokes (think like a programable keyboard) automatically. 
Here are Links to the BadUSB I purchased https://maltronics.com/collections/malduinos/products/malduino-2
and links to the scripting language basics if you want to write a script for something else. https://docs.maltronics.com/badusb-scripting/the-basics
Now heres the code!
